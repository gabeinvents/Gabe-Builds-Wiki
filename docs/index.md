## About
I am a Mechanical Engineer from the US that spends my free time either gardening or making Arduino projects. I created the DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver Breakout Board out of frustration when trying to use the DRV8825 drivers on a breadboard for a CNC project I was working on. My breadboard was a spiderweb of wires and components, making it difficult to try different setups of the drivers. Once I had the boards made, I figured others may also share my frustration and be interested in this board.
